# Teaching Material for Seminars of Supervised Machine Learning

## Week 0: Intro
- introductory exercises to get familiar with R and its syntax

## Week 1: Minimization by Majorization
- implementing the basic iterative loop of minimization by majorization
- explaining the trick of semi-definite matrices for deriving a majorizing function
- creating a visualization in R

Plus here is a [blog post](https://tomasmiskov.com/minimization-by-majorization.html) explaining the concept both in detail and from a bird's eye view.

## Week 2: K-fold Cross Validation
- showing an implementation of k-fold cross validation from scratch in R
- discussing the main goal behind cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

## Week 3: Ridge, Dual Ridge, and Kernel Ridge Regression
- slides and derivations explaining the difference between ridge regression, dual ridge regression, and kernel ridge regression
- implementation of kernel ridge regression
